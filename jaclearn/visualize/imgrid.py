    Create a image grid given the description. The description is a list of axis desc, of format: %d[h|v].
    If the first number n is a positive number, every n images will be concatenated horizontally or vertically.
    We allow exactly one axis desc to be only [h|v], meaning the number of images of that axis will be automatically
    inferred.
